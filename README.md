# Align-sequences-in-Swift
Project to create a prototype application in Swift as a bioinformatics tool.

The project has a compilation error:
"Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "Aline_Wrapper::Aline_seq()", referenced from:
      -[Aline_W Aline_Full] in Aline_W.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)" 
that prevents me from compiling the files, I am not a programmer, this project started as a personal pleasure and I am using it to do my degree thesis but I am completely stuck.
